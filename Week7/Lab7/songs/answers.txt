If songs.db contains the top 100 songs of one listener from 2018, you could characterise their audio aura as:
Firstly, I will determine the average energy of the 100 songs
Then, I will do the same for valence and danceability.

Using the following SQL query, the average for energy, valence and danceability was 0.66, 0.48 and 0.72 respectively (2.d.p):

SELECT AVG(energy) , AVG (valence) , AVG(danceability) FROM songs;

Based on the descriptions from Audio Aura, and the above values, and assuming the spectrum is between 0 and 1, this person tends to be more purple and orange with a need for high energy, with a need to move.
There is a touch of blue to reflect the relatively lower valence.

Using the average across songs would not necessarily be representative of the listener because there could be a big difference in the number of times the listener has listened to the tracks across the 100.
Potentially a better way to calculate would be to take the average based on a smaller number e.g top 10.
